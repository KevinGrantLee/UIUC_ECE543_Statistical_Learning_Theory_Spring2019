**Description:** Statistical learning theory is a burgeoning research field at the intersection of probability, statistics, computer science, and optimization that studies the performance of computer algorithms for making predictions on the basis of training data. The following topics will be covered: basics of statistical decision theory; concentration inequalities; supervised and unsupervised learning; empirical risk minimization; complexity-regularized estimation; generalization bounds for learning algorithms; VC dimension and Rademacher complexities; minimax lower bounds; online learning and optimization. Along with the general theory, we will discuss a number of applications of statistical learning theory to signal processing, information theory, and adaptive control.
